SMART INDIA HACKATHON 2019

This repository contains the backend code for the product prototype we made for the SIH2019's Grand Finale.

Basically our product aims to predict tsunami and alert people, if predicted one.
Also, we plan to help the rescue officials in carrying out the necessary rescue operations through an App+WebPortal.

To get started with this,

source venv/bin/activate
cd sih
python manage.py runserver

For Security purposes, I Have removed all my API keys from sih/keyconfig.py
You need to generate all these keys from your account for getting the app running.
